# Week 4 Challenge: Docker, Kubernetes and GitOps 🚀

## Objective

In this challenge, your task is to demonstrate your proficiency in containerization, orchestration, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) in a Kubernetes environment.

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Dockerize a Web Application:

Containerize a web application using Docker. This step should result in a Docker image that encapsulates your web application and its dependencies.

### 2. Provision a Kubernetes Cluster:

Utilize Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster. You have the choice of deploying on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or locally on Minikube. Select the platform that best suits your needs.

### 3. GitOps on Kubernetes using ArgoCD:

Implement a GitOps pipeline using ArgoCD for deploying your Dockerized web application to the Kubernetes cluster. Automate the deployment process and ensure your application is automatically updated by ArgoCD as soon as there is a change in your GitHub repo.

### 4. Security and Best Practices:

Throughout this challenge, prioritize security and adhere to best practices for containerization, Kubernetes configuration, and CI/CD pipelines. Your solution should demonstrate a commitment to robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure.

## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️

A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog and GitHub Readme 📄

You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post and reference your public GitHub repo. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝

**Here's a suggested outline for your documentation:**

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the challenge and its objectives. 📋
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Provide a detailed completed task walkthrough. Include code examples and configurations where applicable. 💡
- **Challenges Faced**: Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. 🤔
- **Key Takeaways**: Share your key learnings from this week's challenge. 🧐
- **Resources**: List any helpful resources or references you used. 📚

### 3. Screen Recording or Live Website 📽️

Optionally, you can create a screen recording or deploy a live website demonstrating your implementation. This adds an interactive element to your documentation and can be valuable to your portfolio. 🎥
